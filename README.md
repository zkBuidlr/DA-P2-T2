# Phase 2 - NextJs States

In this task of phase 2, you'll need to fix certain bugs of the NextJS app.

## 1
On the home page of the webapp, you'll be greeted with a basic counter webapp. On clicking the `Increase count` button, the counter should increase by one. Fix the bugs in the webapp to make it work as intended.

*You're not allowed to change or add new lines to the useEffect function.*

## 2
In the `/posts`, the useEffect function is incomplete. 
Complete the useEffect function and display the data from the API [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts)

Make sure the states are set properly so that the data is displayed after it is fetched.

## 3
`/posts2` is an alteration of `/posts` where you can add your own posts.
Split the POSTS function into multiple functions. One to fetch the posts, one to display the posts and one to add new posts. Only the function which fetches the posts from the API should contain the posts data. 


## 4
Create a new page `/posts3` where the functions you've created in section 3 are converted to classes.
